# Mandelbrot Set Explorer

The Mandelbrot set is a fascinating fractal generated by iterating over the complex function:

\[ f(z) = z^2 + c \]

This project is helps you to easily vizualize and zoom in or out to get a closer look into the intricacy of this amazing fractal.

## Technologies used

- HTML5 Canvas -For rendering the output.
- JavaScript - For writing the logic.
- WebGl - For getting access to the device's GPU
- Glsl - For writing webGl fragment and vertex shader code.

## Features

1. **Easy Accessibility:**

   - The Mandelbrot set explorer is designed with user-friendly access in mind, providing a straightforward interface for users to interact with and explore the Mandelbrot fractal.

2. **GPU Rendering for Speed:**

   - Utilizes the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) for rendering instead of the Central Processing Unit (CPU), leading to significantly faster rendering times. This optimization enhances the overall performance and responsiveness of the Mandelbrot set exploration.

3. **Extreme Zoom Capability:**

   - Offers the ability to zoom into the Mandelbrot set at an extreme level, allowing users to delve deeply into the intricate details of the fractal. The zoom feature provides an immersive and interactive exploration experience.

4. **Dynamic Fractal Coloring:**
   - Enables users to change the colors of the Mandelbrot fractal on the fly. This dynamic feature allows for real-time customization, providing users with the flexibility to tailor the visual representation of the fractal to their preferences.

These features collectively contribute to creating a powerful and engaging Mandelbrot set explorer that balances accessibility, speed, and customization. Users can seamlessly navigate through the fractal, experience rapid rendering with GPU acceleration, zoom in extensively, and experiment with various color schemes for a personalized exploration experience.
